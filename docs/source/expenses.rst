Track all of your lunch meetings or training materials, and other miscellaneous expenses in project expenses section, and instantly bill clients.
Expenses allow you to capture the billable and non-billable costs that you incur as part of your project work. These non-labor expenses are usually itemized costs for things like materials, travel expenses, or fixed-fee services. Typically, billable expenses are passed on to a client or customer, whereas non-billable expenses are internal costs paid for by your employer.

.. TIP:: You can create Expenses that you incur as part of your business operations (for example, Internet Expenses), or Recurring Expenses for those charges you incur on a frequent basis. 

List Expenses

- **Category**: Select the category from the drop-down list.

Recurring Expenses
"""""""""""""""""""
Some expenses are incurred on a consistent basis over a period of time, and manually recording them each time can get really tedious. Generating these expenses can be automated in Sereni, resulting in systematic tracking.

To make an expense recur, edit the expense and modify **Recurring Expense** field.

You can set a repeat interval such as ``week, month, quarter, six months, year``.

Once you have chosen the interval, you can decide for the repeat to stop by a particular date.

.. TIP:: To stop a recurring expense, edit the expense and change **Recurring Expense** field to **No**.


Invoice Expense
""""""""""""""""""""""

Are you billing a client directly for an expense? To bill an expense, first create an invoice for the client. Open the new invoice and just below the Client address, you'll see a button **Add Expenses** click on the button to open the modal where you can select the expenses to include in the invoice.
