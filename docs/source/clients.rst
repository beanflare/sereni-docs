Your customers are the core of your freelance business. Customers in `Sereni <https://sereni.beanflare.com/>`_ will typically hold all information specific to a company that your organisation will have a relationship with. In real world terms an Account may be a business entity that is a qualified Sales Prospect, Customer, Supplier or Re-seller and can be used to track all interactions that take place between these entities and your organisation. The relationship between the account and contact records is one-to-many, such that there can be many contacts associated with a single account.

Contacts
""""""""
In Sereni, a Contact is an individual who is typically associated with a client (organisation) or Opportunity (qualified prospect). For example if Apple is the Client, then John Smith, Sales Manager of Apple is the Contact. This module holds all information relating to these individuals and also provides a vantage point for any history relating to a Contact record, for example if they sent you an Email.

List Customers
