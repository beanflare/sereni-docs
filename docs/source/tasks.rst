Recurring Tasks
""""""""""""""""
You can create recurring tasks for tasks you have to do again and again as part of a single project.
Before setting a repeat, you will first need to make sure you have a due date set on the task.

When editing the task, you will see the **Recurring Task** field and under this field you can choose when the task should repeat:

You can set a repeat interval such as ``daily, week, month, quarter, six months, year``.

Once you have chosen the interval, you can decide for the repeat to stop by a particular date.

.. Note:: Any files attached to the original task will not carry over to each future repeating task.

.. TIP:: To stop a recurring task, edit the task and change **Recurring Task** field to **No**.

.. TIP:: Reminders are sent based on the due date of the task.
